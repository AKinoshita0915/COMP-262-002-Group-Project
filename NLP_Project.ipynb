The fact is, Epson most of all doesn't want you buying and using less expensive aftermarket ink cartridges in their printers.

Go figure.\\n\\nBeyond the time-soaking issues I experienced with Epson, Amazon's always quick and ready to please. They're currently processing my refund on the second flop that I had to return. I've since reordered from them and received an exemplary 'Brother' printer. I highly recommend that you do the same. Go, Brother ... or try something other.

Overall... it wasn't the best purchase.\\n\\nPROS\\n1- Extremely easy setup.  I set it up to work off of my network print server, as well as wirelessly within about 5 minutes.  I was then able to install and setup 2 Mac computers and 3 PC computers within 20 minutes.  All worked fine and printed without issue to the printer.\\n2- Relatively quiet compared to my old HP.\\n3- Print speed\\n4- Price\\n\\nCONS\\n1- Really, the only problem I found with it was the print quality when printing in color.  I was so disappointed.  Like I said, I switched from a 10 year-old HP color laser.  The colors on my HP were vibrant and true to what my photographs showed.  The colors on this printer's (Brother MFC-9840CDW) print-out were horribly washed out and almost made it look like the photographs were actually faded.\\n\\nAlthough the price of the printer was excellent, I am going to return mine because of the color print quality.  If you don't care about that, this printer is great in every other way.  However, if you are looking for vibrant, true colors, like your photographs show... then I would go with a different printer.\",\n",

She is a laminating junkie and laminates just about everything she can including pictures, proof of insurance certificates, newspaper clippings, recipe cards and even recipes pulled from magazines. Its important to note that my mother is about as anti tech as one can possibly get. It took me a couple years just to get her operating a Mac laptop efficiently. When it comes to technology, she finds even the simplest of things difficult, lol. Anyways, she figured out how to operate the laminating machine in just a few minutes. That's how simple it is to use this system.\\n\\nThe pouches are fantastic as they make aligning of the item super easy. You just pop the item into the pouch and send it through the laminating machine and your all set. The quality is absolutely perfect. No air bubbles and no creases, just a perfectly laminated item. Considering how cheap the laminating machine is, something like this is a no-brainer for people like my mother. The pouches run anywhere from 20 to 33 cents each depending on size.\\n\\nBottom line - This system is extremely affordable and about as easy as something can be to operate. The lamination of important documents is just a smart idea and with a system as easy and affordable as this.....well there is really no excuse not to.\\n\\nHighly recommended.\\n\\n5 stars!\",\n",

One benefit of the colors is that it livened up the cabinets and allowed for some color coordination of topics. Further coordination is forced because these are not single folders but a connected trio of folders, you cannot separate them without tearing them and making them useless.

I will definitely be buying more when I run out.\\nThe reason for the four stars is the packing was terrible!  When it arrived the packing was shredded on all four sides from the terrible packaging.  (Some of the corners of the paper are bent, but I can live with that.)  There was one small packaging bag, but the paper would have benefited from two, one placed on the width and one placed on the height to hold it securely in place.\",\n",

       " 'When I heard about the concept of a sheet-fed scanner, I started looking for one.  Our legal group was laboriously scanning contracts a page at a time via a flat bed scanner.  We found this nifty little device, read the reviews, decided to give it a shot, and the legal group is now much happier.\\n\\nPros:\\n* Fast.  Even with the quality turned up, this scans an entire contract in the time the our Canon flatbed takes to warm up.\\n* Easy.  Once you get the software installed and tweak any settings you feel like tweaking, scanning involves hitting a green button on the face of the scanner and clicking a single button on the screen.  The provided software gives you a thumbnail of each document, lets you easily rename the documents, lets you double-click to view in Adobe or a program of your choice, lets you drag-and-drop documents to the desktop, etc.\\n* Cute.  Okay, \\'cute\\' is probably not a selling point for most IT departments, but it really is!  It has a very small footprint and a clean design in black and silver.  The blue power LED lights up in welcome when you open the document feed cover.\\n* Paper jams are easy to clear.  There\\'s a single silver button that gives easy access to the paper path.\\n* No Engrish.  The manual and software is refreshingly free of mutilated Japanese to \"Engrish\" translations.  I only noticed one or two minor translation glitches.\\n* Good OCR software.  I experimented with searchable PDFs, and the software does a good job of text recognition.\\n* Good software.  I\\'ll be honest, one reason I chose the Fujitsu over a similar Canon product is because I have never liked the look, feel, or usage of Canon\\'s software.  I don\\'t know what the Canon would have been like, but I like the Fujitsu software.  The out-of-the-box defaults work well, the settings are easy to tweak if you need to, and the ScanSnap Manager is intuitive and easy.  There are many, many software options that I haven\\'t tried and probably will never try, but it\\'s nice to have them there just in case I ever need them.\\n* Can scan receipts.  It comes with a plastic sleeve that you can put clippings or smaller pieces of paper inside of for scanning.\\n\\nCons:\\n* Minorly annoying software installation.  There are three different disks to install from -- four if you count a disk full of trial software.  Some of the installation processes have been tweaked since the manual was originally printed, so there are extra paper inserts to describe the new steps.  If you get confused, look through all the manuals and inserts until you find screenshots that match what is happening on the screen.\\n* Doesn\\'t have a TWAIN driver, as has been stated before, but who cares?  It works seamlessly and quickly with the provided software, so this is only a theoretically downside for me.\\n* Not flat bed quality.  If you want exact duplicates of documents without noise or artifacts, get a flat bed.  If you want fast and easy scans and are okay with slightly lower quality, go for it.\\n* Can jam on faster feed modes.  The first document I tried was a 4-page contract that had been stapled in one corner.  Turning down the speed, AKA turning up the scan quality, and changing the feed direction solved the problem.\\n* Can jam on curled papers.  A packet that has been rolled will not feed well until you flatten the papers a bit.\\n\\nI\\'d change my review to 4 stars if I could, but I\\'m still quite happy.',\n",

The pens arrived quickly and came in a vinyl case. The colors are vibrant and the flow is nice too. These give a very pin point line and will handle a lot of fill in as well. The ink is wet enough to blend nicely without leaving those irritating lines and the ink does not taddy up the paper (watercolor/marker/printer paper). These don't bleed to badly either. The 12 assorted colors are true to color, and they offer up a perfect shade the first pass. The micro pigment ink is waterproof and fade proof fine lines. Unlike Copic alcohol markers, these are water-based. Never the less, they are quick drying on porous surfaces and the ink is permanent pigment ink suitable for archival applications. These also blend well too, not as good as Copic of course but, you can get a good color blend. The price is nice too.  item was received on promotion in exchange for my testing and review.\",\n",

It\\'s shaped to fit well in the hand, has a sturdy base with enough weight in it to stay put when you use it, and the lever action delivers an efficient way to staple thicker packets of paper with a lot less effort.  I love the fact that the base is bright orange is it makes it easier to find it on a cluttered surface.  Because the stapling action is so smooth and near effortless, this makes an ideal stapler for those who have arthritis or other painful conditions in their hands or wrists.\\n\\nIt\\'s far too large (more than twice the size of a standard stapler)to fit in a pocket, so this stapler is less likely to go wandering off to live on someone else\\'s desk.  It is not a super quiet stapler, however, compared to electronic staplers that used to be the best option in the higher capacity range, it is very quiet.  (It\\'s about as loud as a standard stapler.)  No more startling the folks on the other side of the office with loud staccato bursts that the automatic varieties produce. I also like that it doesn\\'t use any electricity.  To be honest, I\\'m a little bit afraid of injuring myself with the electric varieties, so this one is a lot less threatening.

We use ours to get groceries from the garage up to our 7th floor condo, so we're not going far, but when you have a couple of weeks worth of food (and beverages!), it saves on multiple trips back down to the garage.  When opened, the cart is sturdy and easy to push/pull, and the basket on the back is handy for smaller items. We've used it for heavy items like a case of wine with no problem.  The issue as others have mentioned is the difficulty of moving the cart in the closed position because of the wheel configuration.  The smaller wheels seem to fold in on themselves so that the big wheels can't roll easily.

For me XL delivers noticeably at least double what I was getting from the standard size, provided I run it close to the ground, and not when the first warning displays.  Canon\\'s own statistics show slightly less than double in their yield tests, even though about 64% (11ml vs 7ml) of it is equal to the standard size.  What this suggests to me, is a lot of ink being \"lost\" in the mechanisms used for delivering dye to paper.  Whether it be coincidence or not I\\'ve found after having to dump two printers, this brand name is far more reliable than its imitating cousins.\\n\\nWhether it be premature clogging, or the size imperfectly matching the alleged compatibility resulting in physical damage, none of this happened as long as I stayed with Canon.  While I like saving money, and I do understand that getting an entire set of the name-brand is almost the same price as a new printer, nah, with the XL sizes it will last twice as long (my experience) the size the printer comes pre-loaded, assuming you get a full \"standard\" size.

The biggest problem I have with it is that when you pull up to peel off tape (and I'm not even talking about a 12-noon angle here, I mean just any kind of up), the whole roll and core pop out of the dispenser and must be replaced before one can carrrrefully extract tape from this thing.  And this is not a sometimes kind of thing.  This happens every freakin time I use the dispenser.  Because I'm stubborn and refused to take it back to the store, I just taped (irony!) some pieces of cardboard over the grooves where the dispenser sits so that it can no longer come out.  Of course, I have to destroy this every time the tape runs out, but otherwise the dispenser would be almost unusable.\\n\\nThe other issue that I have is that I don't think it's heavy enough, but that is from a preference standpoint, I think, and less of a universal issue.  Sadly, though, instead of using one hand to grab tape, pull up, and dispense as needed, one must use two hands for the dispenser, pull at a zero degree angle, and dispense as needed.  That pretty much rules out gift wrapping, poster hanging, or any other one-hand-is-holding-this-thing-together activities.  It's a shame, because this thing is really extremely adorable and looks great, enough to get it two stars even!

My garage is 60 feet from my front door and parts of the house are 100 feet and a flight of stairs away.  This allows me to see a picture, video, and talk to my visitor without running any wires (except power for the doorbell).  I can see and talk to somebody at the door from my bedroom, kitchen, or anywhere I have a phone.\\n\\nIt has an intercom function so I can talk between phones at no extra cost.  Voices don\\'t carry in my house so yelling for somebody to come to dinner will do no good.  I also like the talking caller ID.  I don\\'t have to go to the phone to know who is calling.  You can turn off the answering machine so your phone service can take voicemail.  It also has a \"Do Not Disturb Feature.\"  It will tell the phone not to ring for incoming calls.\\n\\nWhat is truly disappointing is that there is a delay in the doorbell camera.  Normally I get a picture of the back of the mailman as he leaves instead of his face as he rings the bell.  If somebody stands near the doorbell for 10 seconds after they push the button you will see them, but 10 seconds is a long time for a camera delay.\\n\\nThe screen is very small so you will not get detail.  However, I can tell if it is somebody I know or not.  That is mostly what I care about.  I also have not found any way to get the pictures from the phone to external media.  If I want a record for some reason I will not get it.  Overall, I would recommend the system, but understand in advance it has limitations.\\n\\nOne more suggestion.  You can combine this with a phone service which has Bluetooth like Verizon, Ooma, or buy a third party Bluetooth to phone device to link in your cell phone.  Now, if my doorbell or cell phone ring I can just answer my house landline phone.',\n",

I have an older edition of Print Shop that I love, but it doesn't have these labels as an option. I scoured the Avery website looking for the measurements/layout of these sheets so I could manually add them, but they're not provided. I have in the past measured things myself to enter them, but I've never had great results with that. I've always had to spend a lot of time fine tuning my measurements. I also figured that since they were round, I'd have a harder time lining everything up correctly. So, I used the templates provided by Avery in Word. YUCK. Yes, I'm sure the templates themselves were correct, but working with them in word was a PAIN. If I had a pre-made round image ready to go that I could have just pasted on there I probably would have been fine. My process is more of a layering job. Image, text box, image, text box, etc... Very annoying to work out in Word. I had to keep moving the preset margins so that my square image could go where I wanted it to. If I moved the wrong margin, the template would disappear. Also, in Word you have to create each label on the page, in Print Shop I could have made one and it would have duplicated it on the others on the same page. It took me almost four hours to get the first page right in Word. After that I could fairly easily change out text and color to get the labels right for each product.\\n\\nSo, end product is GREAT. Process to get there was painful. Lesson, check your software to see if it includes this label (22807) or understand it might be a pain to get the label how you want it by other means.\\n\\nOh, but I love it!\",\n",
