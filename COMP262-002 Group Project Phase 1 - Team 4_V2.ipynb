Only complaint (I should have read the description better!) is that every label has to be trimmed somewhat. I naively assumed that shipping labels were a standard size, since the labels on my Amazon purchases seemed perfect.\\nOverall I think I will like them better as time goes on. I still save money also since the xyron was wayyyyy more costly, plus I no longer am using all that tape.   \n",

When i draw with them, they produce a clear, precise line. If they came in different sizes of nibs, i would easily have these over Sakura Microns ^.^ due to how quickly they dry (i couldn't make them smudge, even while trying very hard to smudge it directly after applying the ink to the page), and unlike the Microns, they don't leak...   \n",

Only complaint (I should have read the description better!) is that every label has to be trimmed somewhat. I naively assumed that shipping labels were a standard size, since the labels on my Amazon purchases seemed perfect.\\nOverall I think I will like them better as time goes on. I still save money also since the xyron was wayyyyy more costly, plus I no longer am using all that tape.   \n",

When i draw with them, they produce a clear, precise line. If they came in different sizes of nibs, i would easily have these over Sakura Microns ^.^ due to how quickly they dry (i couldn't make them smudge, even while trying very hard to smudge it directly after applying the ink to the page), and unlike the Microns, they don't leak...   \n",

      "This just came today and really like it. Perfect for what I bought it for - a writer's journal. A writing course I'm taking on setting and description recommended that I keep a writer's journal for writing down description or pieces of overheard conversation and the like to practice the craft and maybe even use in my own writing. I wanted something that would fit in my purse that I could carry with me . I love the fact that I can get either blank or lined paper - I love the paper, period. I got the blank so that I could also do some sketches.\n",

      "This is the same size as my 7-inch Kindle Fire, which makes it perfect and the color actually matches my purse. The material is stiff and will probably be so until it's well run in but it doesn't bother me. The whole point of the loose leaf version is so the paper can be taken in or out as needed. I have no trouble writing in it with the rings. Mine does have the slots in the flap. Not sure what those are supposed to be for. The picture does show the embossing in the lower corner with the company name but mine did not have that, which is fine. I do prefer it that way. It did make it look like the journal belonged to someone named Valery. Might have been nice to have my own name embossed there but not all that important to me.\n",
